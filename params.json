  "body": "### Welcome to JMath, the extended mathematics library for Java!  \r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cypaubr/JMath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Cypaubr/JMath)  \r\nJMath provide a bunch of mathematics oriented functionnalities (e.g. function derivatives, analytical geometry, matrix calculations etc. (see Wiki if you want the whole list of features)).\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nFor the moment, the only way to install JMath is to build your own JAR library from the master branch (see the Wiki for the 'how to'). Don't worry, I will set up a Bintray repository for the first version and each version will be available in the 'Release' section of GitHub as JAR.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nHere is a simple utilisation of JMath:  \r\n```java\r\n//creating 3 points\r\nPoint A = new Point(2,4);  \r\nPoint B = new Point(0,0);  \r\nPoint C = new Point(7.5,9);  \r\n\r\nTriangle t = new Triangle(A,B,C); //creating a triangle from the 3 points\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Permimeter of the triangle is:\" + t.getPerimeter()); //side length are auto-calculated with perimeter\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nEveryone can contribute to Jmath by adding features, correcting bugs and improve tests. The only rules are:\r\n+ You must push your modifications on a separated Git branch\r\n+ You must write unit tests (with JUnit) and these tests must me compliant with the other tests (take a look to the tests on the master branch to get an idea) and with the Gradle Build Tool.\r\n+ **Your tests musl all pass before you push onto your branch**, else it will not be merged into the master branch and your modifications will be ignored... forever...\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCyprien Aubry @cypaubr - Creator & Lead Developer  \r\n_If you contributed, your username should appear hear_\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you encounter bug during JMath usage or during development, please use the \"Issues\" section of GitHub.\r\nIf you are not sure about the usage of JMath, please consider reading the Wiki and the API.\r\n",
